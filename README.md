# my_farm
this farm is fun!
his week I started the "villa platzi" project. it's a farm with  animals such as  chickens, cows and pigs. 
The project isn't finished but I am learning many new things, like for example how  to use mathematical functions and random numbers. 
Now, I'd like to learn github, to send you the projects in a better way.
